This script generates 1000 random scenarios, each with a 60% chance of being "good," a 30% chance of being "neutral," and a 10% chance of being "bad." For each scenario, the script calculates the corresponding return based on the expected returns for each scenario. Finally, the script calculates the average return and standard deviation of the returns, and prints the results.
Of course, this is just a basic example, and you would need to modify the script to suit your specific needs and requirements. For example, you might want to use more complex probabilities or expected returns, or you might want to perform additional calculations or analyses. Additionally, you would need to provide your own input data, such as the probabilities and expected returns for each scenario. I hope this example is helpful as a starting point for your own Monte Carlo analysis using Python.
